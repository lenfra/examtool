# TODO: When trying to get exam stats for exam 'DT153Gv10e5' I get the following:

# (ExamGen.py:8228): Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'ExamGen.py' received an X Window System error.
# This probably reflects a bug in the program.
# The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
#  (Details: serial 22818 error_code 11 request_code 53 (core protocol) minor_code 0)
#  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
#   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
#   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
#   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
#   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
